# Movie Recommender System

This project is a content-based movie recommender system designed to provide personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to analyze movie descriptions and generate relevant recommendations.

## Features

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies based on the similarity of content features, such as plot descriptions and genres.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Uses stemming and tokenization to preprocess movie descriptions, improving the accuracy of similarity calculations.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Computes similarity scores between movies to identify and recommend movies that align with user preferences.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommender-system.git
   cd movie-recommender-system
   ```
2. **Install the required dependencies**:
Ensure you have pip installed, then run:
   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Usage**:
To start the movie recommender system, use the following command:
   ```bash
    streamlit run main.py

This command will launch a Streamlit web application, where you can interact with the recommender system and receive movie recommendations based on your inputs.

## How It Works
1. Data Preprocessing: The system preprocesses movie descriptions using NLP techniques like stemming and tokenization.
2. Feature Extraction: It extracts features from the text data using CountVectorizer or similar techniques to convert text into numerical vectors.
3. Similarity Calculation: The model uses cosine similarity to compare the feature vectors and find movies similar to the input movie or user profile.
4. Recommendations: Based on the similarity scores, the system recommends movies that are most similar to the user's preferences.
